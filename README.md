### Additional Information
----------------------
- My starting point was the [SparkFun PicoBuck](https://github.com/sparkfun/PicoBuck) LED driver, which was a collaboration with Ethan Zonca.
- I used Eagle CAD 7.2.0 (a version current in early 2015).
- I added thermal foldback and dimming.
- I designed this board in 2015 at the request of [Traxda, LLC](https://www.traxda.com/) in Tucson, Arizona, USA.
- This was my first LED board, my first constant-current power supply, my first use of thermal foldback, my first dimming LED driver, and my first PCB. Back in 2015, I was unable to find a subcontractor with the equipment to test for electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) or otherwise review my design. My client, Traxda, opted not to have me finish, and I moved on to other things.
- In 2023, I am thinking of using the design for something related to LiFi and OpenVLC.
