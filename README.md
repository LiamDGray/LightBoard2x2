- I designed this in 2015 for Traxda, LLC, Tucson, Arizona, USA.
- My starting point was the SparkFun PicoBuck LED Driver, which was a collaboration with Ethan Zonca.
- I used Eagle 7.2.6 (a version current in early 2015).
- I added thermal foldback and dimming.
- This was my first LED board, my first constant-current power supply, my first use of thermal foldback, my first dimming LED driver, and my first PCB.
- If you have any suggestions, please open an issue or, better yet, make a pull request!
